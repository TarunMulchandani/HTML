# HTML Learning – Revision Notes

This repository contains my practice and notes for basic HTML concepts. Below are the topics I’ve covered so far:

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 1. Headings
HTML provides six levels of headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>`.  
`<h1>` is the most important (largest), and `<h6>` is the least important (smallest).

### 2. Paragraphs
The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph.  
Browsers automatically add some space before and after a paragraph for readability.

### 3. Void Elements
Void elements are **self-closing tags** that do not have closing tags.

- `<br>` – Inserts a line break (used to move text to a new line).
- `<hr>` – Inserts a horizontal line (used to separate content or sections).
